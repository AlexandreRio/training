#### Create your own stuff
You should now be able to make something (somewhat) useful with Kevoree  


Note: Do not get stuck for hours if you struggle implementing your amazing ideas with Kevoree.
We (Olivier and Maxime) will be happy to help. However, we won't do your work, just provide hints and assistance.
If you are part of the HEADS consortium, you are actually paid to struggle a bit and use Kevoree,
that is what a research project is all about ;-)

Note: you can use any component/group/channel/node available in the Kevoree Standard Library
