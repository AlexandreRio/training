HEADS ThingML modelling language basics

Now that you have learned the basics of ThingML and Kevoree (tutorial 1 and 2), it is time to combine them! 

ThingML is the HEADS modelling language dedicated to the implementation of your HD-services. It provides a white-box view on your services. Kevoree manages these implementations as black-boxes and will deploy and dynamically manage the HD-services.

**This tutorial covers:**

* Simple exercice to understand the mapping between ThingML and Kevoree, in Java
* Based on your contribution in the tutorial 1 on ThingML, use the Kevoree/Java wrapper and deploy your simple HD-service with Kevoree
* Manually wrap Node.JS code produced by ThingML into a Kevoree/JS component, based on your knowledge acquired in tutorial 2. This will be very helpful to automate the Kevoree/JS wrapping later on.
